        <strong>New server!!</strong><br />
        Thanks to many people telling me how sad they were when I said I might have to shutdown the project due to server issues, <br />
        I tried porting the system to a new server and it seems it's working!<br />
        <br />
        No guarantees yet that it won't crash and burn, but the upgrade to a new server with SSDs instead of some old HDD might actually help a lot! <br />
        <br />
