        <strong>GW2Spidy might be shutting down!</strong> <br />
        <p>
            After 6 years of running GW2Spidy we've reached the point where I might need to shutdown the project. <br />
            <br />
            The server that has been running GW2Spidy is looking like it's about to die and I don't have the time or energy to move the project to a new server (which is a huge effort, considering the 60GB database). <br />
            <br />
            <b>I'll try to save the server and keep it running, but it's a 50/50 chance ...</b>
            <br />
            In case it dies, I want to thank all the users, specially the early day users and contributors, it's been such a fun project thanks to all of you &lt;3 <br />
            <br />
            I'm sorry for all the people who are still using GW2Spidy, I hope I can keep things alive!<br />
